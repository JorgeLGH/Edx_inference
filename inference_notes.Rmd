# Section 1

## Objectives

1. Understand how to use a sampling model to perform a poll.
2. Explain the terms population, parameter, and sample as they relate to statistical inference.
3. Use a sample to estimate the population proportion from the sample average.
4. Calculate the expected value and standard error of the sample average. 

### Understand how to use a sampling model to perform a poll
Loads the needed library and sets an example of a sample of 25 that have two possible states. In this case, the *urn* from which the sample is taken, doesn´t show itlsef so that we have to estimate the proportion of the balls
```{r warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
ds_theme_set()
take_poll(25)#takes a random sample of an urn withg red and blue balls, it is with replacements
```
